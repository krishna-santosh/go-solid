# Go Solid 

**Go Solid** is a template designed for creating cross-platform applications with a web interface using the Go programming language and Solid.js library.

The end result of this template is a single executable binary. This binary serves as a web server, hosting both the Solid.js frontend and an API.

:warning: This template is still a work in progress :construction:
